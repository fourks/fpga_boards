# FPGA Board Support

The following FPGA boards have been tested with Project F. You can find Vivado constraints for these boards in this repository.

Other FPGA boards with similar FPGAs and I/O should be easy to adapt to Project F, but you will have to provide suitable constraints files yourself.
