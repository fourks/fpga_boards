# FPGA Board Support

The following FPGA boards have been tested with Project F. You can find [Vivado constraints](vivado/constraints/) files for these boards in this repository.

Other FPGA boards with similar FPGAs and I/O should be easy to adapt to Project F, but you will have to provide suitable contraints files yourself.
