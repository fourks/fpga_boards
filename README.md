# Project F Hardware Support
Hardware support for Project F.

## Tested Boards
The following FPGA board have been tested with Project F:

* [Digilent Nexys Video](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/start) (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A200T)
* [Digilent Arty Original](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/start) (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T)

You can find [constraints](constraints/) files for these boards in this repository. Similar Digilent boards, such as the Arty A7, S7, and Basys 3, will work with minor changes to the constraints.

## Planned Board Support
We plan to support the following boards once we receive hardware and test them out:

* [iCEBreaker](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker) (Lattice iCE40UP5K)
* [Alchitry Cu](https://alchitry.com/collections/frontpage/products/alchitry-au) (Lattice iCE40-HX8K)
* [Alchitry Au](https://alchitry.com/collections/frontpage/products/alchitry-au) (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T)

_iCEBreaker is due to launch in summer 2019. We already have the Alchitry FPGA boards, but are awaiting the release of the HDMI expansion board._
